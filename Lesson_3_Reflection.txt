When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
  You want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all of your work local if you would like to store your files and commits in the cloud to allow for easy backups and collaboration.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  You might want to manually pull changes because there is a good chance you want some of the stuff that is on GitHub to stay only on GitHub and not copy it to your local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks, clones, and branches are all different ways to have different versions of different files in different places but they are all slightly different.  Forking a repository does virtually the same thing as cloning it but it has more ties to the original owner's repository and gives them credit and allows you to request changes.  Branches allow you to try out different aspects within your code but seperate the changes from your original project so you do not ruin it if you make a mistake.
